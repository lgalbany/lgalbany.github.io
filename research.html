                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">We analyze 143 Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) observed in H band (1.6-1.8 μm) and find SNeIa are intrinsically brighter in H-band with increasing host galaxy stellar mass. We find SNeIa in galaxies more massive than 1010.43M⊙ are 0.13±0.04 mag brighter in H than SNeIa in less massive galaxies. The same set of SNeIa observed at optical wavelengths, after width-color-luminosity corrections, exhibit a 0.10±0.03 mag offset in the Hubble residuals. We observe an outlier population (|ΔHmax|&gt;0.5 mag) in the H band and show that removing the outlier population moves the mass threshold to 1010.65M⊙ and reduces the step in H band to 0.08±0.04 mag, but the equivalent optical mass step is increased to 0.13±0.04 mag. We conclude the outliers do not drive the brightness--host-mass correlation. Less massive galaxies preferentially host more higher-stretch SNeIa, which are intrinsically brighter and bluer. It is only after correction for width-luminosity and color-luminosity relationships that SNeIa have brighter optical Hubble residuals in more massive galaxies. Thus finding SNeIa are intrinsically brighter in H in more massive galaxies is an opposite correlation to the intrinsic (pre-width-luminosity correction) optical brightness. If dust and the treatment of intrinsic color variation were the main driver of the host galaxy mass correlation, we would not expect a correlation of brighter H-band SNeIa in more massive galaxies.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">The success of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) distance standardisation for cosmology relies on a single global linear relationship between their peak luminosity and colour, the β parameter. However, there are several pieces of evidence and physical reasons to believe that this relation is not universal and may change within different subgroups, or even among individual objects. In this work, we allow β to vary among subpopulations with different observed properties in the cosmological fits. Although the inferred cosmological parameters are consistent with previous studies that assume a single colour-luminosity relation, we find that the SN data favour nonuniversal distributions of β when split according to SN colour and/or host-galaxy mass. For galaxy mass, we obtain a β-step relation in which low β values occur in more massive galaxies, a trend that can be explained by differing dust reddening laws for two types of environments. For colour, we find that bluer/redder SNe Ia are consistent with a lower/larger β. This trend is explained with β being a combination of a low intrinsic colour-luminosity relation dominant in bluer SNe and a higher extrinsic reddening relation dominant at redder colours. The host galaxy mass-step correction always provides better distance calibration, regardless of the multiple β approaches, and we suggest that it may come from a difference in intrinsic colour-luminosity properties of SNe Ia in two types of environments. Additionally, we find that blue SNe in low-mass environments are better standard candles than the others.<br><br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">We present a multi-wavelength photometric and spectroscopic analysis of thirteen "Super-Chandrasekhar Mass"/2003fg-like type Ia Supernova (SNe~Ia). Nine of these objects were observed by the Carnegie Supernova Project. 2003fg-like have slowly declining light curves ( Δm15 (B)  &lt; 1.3 mag), and peak absolute  B -band magnitudes between  −19&lt;MB&lt;−21 mag.&nbsp;Many 2003fg-like are located in the same part of the luminosity width relation as normal SNe~Ia. In the optical  B  and  V  bands, 2003fg-like look like normal SNe~Ia, but at redder wavelengths they diverge. Unlike other luminous SNe~Ia, 2003fg-like generally have only one  i -band maximum which peaks after the epoch of  B -band maximum, while their NIR light curve rise times can be  ≳ 40 days longer than those of normal SNe~Ia. They are also at least one magnitude brighter in the NIR bands than normal SNe~Ia, peaking above  MH&lt;−19 ~mag, and generally have negative Hubble residuals, which may be the cause of some systematics in dark energy experiments. Spectroscopically, 2003fg-like exhibit peculiarities such as unburnt carbon well past maximum light, a large spread (8000--12000~km/s) in SiII  λ 6355 velocities at maximum light with no rapid early velocity decline, and no clear  H -band break at +10~d, e. We find that SNe with a larger pseudo equivalent width of CII at maximum light have lower SiII  λ 6355 velocities and slower declining light curves. There are also multiple factors that contribute to the peak luminosity of 2003fg-like. The explosion of a C-O degenerate core inside a carbon-rich envelope is consistent with these observations. Such a configuration may come from the core degenerate scenario.&nbsp;<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">
                        We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the 03fg-like Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) ASASSN-15hy from the ultraviolet (UV) to the near-infrared (NIR). ASASSN-15hy shares many of the hallmark characteristics of 03fg-like SNe Ia, previously referred to as "super-Chandrasekhar" SNe Ia. It is bright in the UV and NIR, lacks a clear i-band secondary maximum, shows a strong and persistent C II feature, and has a low Si II λ6355 velocity. However, some of its properties are also extreme among the subgroup. ASASSN-15hy is underluminous (MB,peak =  −19.14+0.11−0.16  mag), red (  (B−V)Bmax =0.18+0.01−0.03  mag), yet slowly declining (Δm15(B) = 0.72 ± 0.04 mag). It has the most delayed onset of the i-band maximum of any 03fg-like SN. ASASSN-15hy lacks the prominent H-band break emission feature that is typically present during the first month past maximum in normal SNe Ia. Such events may be a potential problem for high-redshift SN Ia cosmology. ASASSN-15hy may be explained in the context of an explosion of a degenerate core inside a nondegenerate envelope. The explosion impacting the nondegenerate envelope with a large mass provides additional luminosity and low ejecta velocities. An initial deflagration burning phase is critical in reproducing the low 56Ni mass and luminosity, while the large core mass is essential in providing the large diffusion timescales required to produce the broad light curves. The model consists of a rapidly rotating 1.47 M⊙ degenerate core and a 0.8 M⊙ nondegenerate envelope. This "deflagration core-degenerate" scenario may result from the merger between a white dwarf and the degenerate core of an asymptotic giant branch star.</p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">This work aims to study different probes of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) progenitors that have been suggested to be linked to the presence of circumstellar material (CSM). In particular, we have investigated, for the first time, the link between narrow blueshifted Na I D absorption profiles and the presence and strength of the broad high-velocity Ca II near-infrared triplet absorption features seen in SNe Ia around maximum light. With the probes exploring different distances from the SN; Na I D &gt; 1017cm, high-velocity Ca II features &lt; 1015cm. For this, we have used a new intermediate-resolution X-shooter spectral sample of 15 SNe Ia. We do not identify a link between these two probes, implying either that, one (or both) is not physically related to the presence of CSM or that the occurrence of CSM at the distance explored by one probe is not linked to its presence at the distance probed by the other. However, the previously identified statistical excess in the presence of blueshifted (over redshifted) Na I D absorption is confirmed in this sample at high significance and is found to be stronger in SNe Ia hosted by late-type galaxies. This excess is difficult to explain as being from an interstellar-medium origin as has been suggested by some recent modelling, as such an origin is not expected to show a bias for blueshifted absorption. However, a circumstellar origin for these features also appears unsatisfactory based on our new results, given the lack of link between the two probes of CSM investigated.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">
                        Constraining the delay-time distribution (DTD) of different supernova (SN) types can shed light on the timescales of galaxy chemical enrichment and feedback processes affecting galaxy dynamics, and SN progenitor properties. Here, we present an approach to recover SN DTDs based on integral field spectroscopy (IFS) of their host galaxies. Using a statistical analysis of a sample of 116 supernovae in 102 galaxies, we evaluate different DTD models for SN types Ia (73), II (28) and Ib/c (15). We find the best SN Ia DTD fit to be a power law with an exponent α = −1.1±0.3 (50% confidence interval), and a time delay (between star formation and the first SNe) ∆ = 50+100−35 Myr (50% C.I.). For core collapse (CC) SNe, both of the Zapartas et al. (2017) DTD models for single and binary stellar evolution are consistent with our results. For SNe II and Ib/c, we find a correlation with a Gaussian DTD model with σ = 82+129 −23 Myr and σ = 56+141−9 Myr (50% C.I.) respectively. This analysis demonstrates that integral field spectroscopy opens a new way of studying SN DTD models in the local universe.</p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">
                        The use of SNe Ia to measure cosmological parameters has grown significantly over the past two decades. However, there exists a significant diversity in the SN Ia population that is not well understood. Overluminous SN 1991T-like and subluminous SN 1991bg-like objects are two characteristic examples of peculiar SNe. The identification and classification of such objects is an important step in studying what makes them unique from the remaining SN population. With the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory promising on the order of a million new SNe over a 10 year survey, spectroscopic classifications will be possible for only a small subset of observed targets. As such, photometric classification has become an increasingly important concern in preparing for the next generation of astronomical surveys. Using observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey II (SDSS-II) SN Survey, we apply here an empirically based classification technique targeted at the identification of SN 1991bg-like SNe in photometric data sets. By performing dedicated fits to photometric data in the rest-frame redder and bluer bandpasses, we classify 16 previously unidentified 91bg-like SNe. Using SDSS-II host galaxy measurements, we find that these SNe are preferentially found in host galaxies with an older average stellar age than the hosts of normal SNe Ia. We also find that these SNe are found at a further physical distance from the center of their host galaxies. We find no statistically significant bias in host galaxy mass or specific star formation rate for these targets.</p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">Progressive increases in the precision of the Hubble-constant measurement via Cepheid-calibrated Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have shown a discrepancy of ∼4.4σ with the current value inferred from Planck satellite measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation and the standard Λcold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmological model. This disagreement does not appear to be due to known systematic errors and may therefore be hinting at new fundamental physics. Although all of the current techniques have their own merits, further improvement in constraining the Hubble constant requires the development of as many independent methods as possible. In this work, we use SNe II as standardisable candles to obtain an independent measurement of the Hubble constant. Using seven SNe II with host-galaxy distances measured from Cepheid variables or the tip of the red giant branch, we derive H0=75.8+5.2−4.9 km s−1 Mpc−1 (statistical errors only). Our value favours that obtained from the conventional distance ladder (Cepheids + SNe Ia) and exhibits a difference of 8.4 km s−1 Mpc−1 from the Planck + ΛCDM value. Adding an estimate of the systematic errors (2.8 km s−1 Mpc−1) changes the ∼1.7σ discrepancy with Planck +ΛCDM to ∼1.4σ. Including the systematic errors and performing a bootstrap simulation, we confirm that the local H0 value exceeds the value from the early Universe with a confidence level of 95 per cent. As in this work, we only exchange SNe II for SNe Ia to measure extragalactic distances, we demonstrate that there is no evidence that SNe Ia are the source of the H0 tension.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">Despite vast improvements in the measurement of the cosmological parameters, the nature of dark energy and an accurate value of the Hubble constant (H0) in the Hubble–Lemaître law remain unknown. To break the current impasse, it is necessary to develop as many independent techniques as possible, such as the use of Type II supernovae (SNe II). The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the utility of SNe II for deriving accurate extragalactic distances, which will be an asset for the next generation of telescopes where more-distant SNe II will be discovered. More specifically, we present a sample from the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN) consisting of 15 SNe II with photometric and spectroscopic information spanning a redshift range up to 0.35. Combining our DES SNe with publicly available samples, and using the standard candle method (SCM), we construct the largest available Hubble diagram with SNe II in the Hubble flow (70 SNe II) and find an observed dispersion of 0.27 mag. We demonstrate that adding a colour term to the SN II standardization does not reduce the scatter in the Hubble diagram. Although SNe II are viable as distance indicators, this work points out important issues for improving their utility as independent extragalactic beacons: find new correlations, define a more standard subclass of SNe II, construct new SN II templates, and dedicate more observing time to high-redshift SNe II. Finally, for the first time, we perform simulations to estimate the redshift-dependent distance-modulus bias due to selection effects..<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">AT 2018cow was the nearest and best-studied example of a new breed of extragalactic, luminous, and rapidly evolving transient. Both the progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms of these rapid transients remain a mystery – the energetics, spectral signatures, and time-scales make them challenging to interpret in established classes of supernovae and tidal disruption events. The rich, multiwavelength data set of AT 2018cow has still left several interpretations viable to explain the nature of this event. In this paper, we analyze integral-field spectroscopic data of the host galaxy, CGCG 137-068, to compare environmental constraints with leading progenitor models. We find the explosion site of AT 2018cow to be very typical of core-collapse supernovae (known to form from stars with MZAMS ∼ 8−25 M⊙), and infer a young stellar population age at the explosion site of few × 10 Myr, at slightly sub-solar metallicity. When comparing to expectations for exotic intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) tidal disruption events, we find no evidence for a potential host system of the IMBH. In particular, there are no abrupt changes in metallicity or kinematics in the vicinity of the explosion site, arguing against the presence of a distinct host system. The proximity of AT 2018cow to strong star formation in the host galaxy makes us favour a massive stellar progenitor for this event..<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">We present a comprehensive dataset of optical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of type Ia supernova (SN) 2016hnk, combined with integral field spectroscopy (IFS) of its host galaxy, MCG -01-06-070, and nearby environment. Our goal with this complete dataset is to understand the nature of this peculiar object. Properties of the SN local environment are characterized by means of single stellar population synthesis applied to IFS observations taken two years after the SN exploded. We performed detailed analyses of SN photometric data by studying its peculiar light and color curves. SN 2016hnk spectra were compared to other 1991bg-like SNe Ia, 2002es-like SNe Ia, and Ca-rich transients. In addition, we used abundance stratification modeling to identify the various spectral features in the early phase spectral sequence and also compared the dataset to a modified non-LTE model previously produced for the sublumnious SN 1999by. SN 2016hnk is consistent with being a subluminous (MB =−16.7 mag, sBV=0.43±0.03), highly reddened object. The IFS of its host galaxy reveals both a significant amount of dust at the SN location, residual star formation, and a high proportion of old stellar populations in the local environment compared to other locations in the galaxy, which favors an old progenitor for SN 2016hnk. Inspection of a nebular spectrum obtained one year after maximum contains two narrow emission lines attributed to the forbidden [Ca ii] λλ7291,7324 doublet with a Doppler shift of 700kms−1. Based on various observational diagnostics, we argue that the progenitor of SN 2016hnk was likely a near Chandrasekhar-mass (MCh) carbon-oxygen white dwarf that produced 0.108 M⊙ of 56Ni. Our modeling suggests that the narrow [Ca ii] features observed in the nebular spectrum are associated with 48Ca from electron capture during the explosion, which is expected to occur only in white dwarfs that explode near or at the MCh limit.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">There is observational evidence of a dearth in core-collapse supernova (ccSN) explosions from stars with zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) mass M0 ≈ 17–30M⊙, referred to as the ‘red supergiant problem’. However, simulations now predict that above 20 M⊙ we should indeed only expect stars within certain pockets of M0 to produce a visible SN explosion. Validating these predictions requires large numbers of ccSNe of different types with measured M0, which is challenging. In this paper, we explore the reliability of using host galaxy emission lines and the H α equivalent width to constrain the age, and thus the M0 of ccSNe progenitors. We use Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis models to infer a stellar population age from MUSE observations of the ionized gas properties and H α EW at the location of eleven ccSNe with reliable M0 measurements. Comparing our results to published M0 values, we find that models that do not consider binary systems yield stellar ages that are systematically too young (thus M0 too large), whereas accounting for binary system interactions typically overpredict the stellar age (thus underpredict M0). Taking into account the effects of photon leakage bring our M0 estimates in much closer agreement with expectations. These results highlight the need for careful modelling of diffuse environments, such as are present in the vicinity of Type II SNe, before ionized emission line spectra can be used as reliable tracers of progenitor stellar age.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of the Type II supernova ASASSN-14jb, together with Very Large Telescope (VLT) Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) integral field observations of its host galaxy and a nebular-phase spectrum. This supernova, in the nearby galaxy ESO 467-G051 (z = 0.006), was discovered and followed-up by the all-sky automated survey for supernovae (ASAS-SN). We obtained well-sampled las cumbres network (LCOGTN) BVgri and Swift w2m1w1ubv optical, near- UV/optical light curves, and several optical spectra in the early photospheric phases. The transient ASASSN-14jb exploded ∼2 kpc above the star-forming disk of ESO 467-G051, an edge-on disk galaxy. The large projected distance from the disk of the supernova position and the non-detection of any H II region in a 1.4 kpc radius in projection are in conflict with the standard environment of core-collapse supernova progenitors and suggests the possible scenario that the progenitor received a kick in a binary interaction. We present analysis of the optical light curves and spectra, from which we derived a distance of 25 ± 2 Mpc using state-of-the-art empirical methods for Type II SNe, physical properties of the SN explosion (56 Ni mass, explosion energy, and ejected mass), and properties of the progenitor; namely the progenitor radius, mass, and metallicity. Our analysis yields a 56 Ni mass of 0.0210 ± 0.0025 M⊙ , an explosion energy of ≈0.25×10^51 ergs, and an ejected mass of ≈6M⊙. We also constrained the progenitor radius to be R∗ =580±28 R⊙ which seems to be consistent with the sub-Solar metallicity of 0.3 ± 0.1 Z⊙ derived from the supernova Fe II λ5018 line. The nebular spectrum constrains strongly the progenitor mass to be in the range 10–12 M⊙. From the Spitzer data archive we detect ASASSN-14jb ≈330 days past explosion and we derived a total dust mass of 10−4 M⊙ from the 3.6 μm and 4.5 μm photometry. Using the FUV, NUV, BVgri,Ks, 3.6 μm, and 4.5 μm total magnitudes for the host galaxy, we fit stellar population synthesis models, which give an estimate of M∗ ≈ 1 × 109 M⊙ , an age of 3.2 Gyr, and a SFR ≈0.07 M⊙ yr−1 . We also discuss the low oxygen abundance of the host galaxy derived from the MUSE data, having an average of 12 + log (O/H) = 8.27+0.16 using the O3N2 diagnostic with strong line methods. We compared it with the supernova spectra, which is also consistent with a sub-Solar metallicity progenitor. Following recent observations of extraplanar H II regions in nearby edge-on galaxies, we derived the metallicity offset from the disk, being positive, but consistent with zero at 2σ, suggesting enrichment from disk outflows. We finally discuss the possible scenarios for the unusual environment for ASASSN-14jb and conclude that either the in-situ star formation or runaway scenario would imply a low-mass progenitor, agreeing with our estimate from the supernova nebular spectrum. Regardless of the true origin of ASASSN-14jb, we show that the detailed study of the environment roughly agree with the stronger constraints from the observation of the transient.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">We describe the simulated data sample for the Photometric Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) Astronomical Time Series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC), a publicly available challenge to classify transient and variable events that will be observed by the LSST, a new facility expected to start in the early 2020s. The challenge was hosted by Kaggle, ran from 2018 September 28 to December 17, and included 1094 teams competing for prizes. Here we provide details of the 18 transient and variable source models, which were not revealed until after the challenge, and release the model libraries. We describe the LSST Operations Simulator used to predict realistic observing conditions, and we describe the publicly available SNANA simulation code used to transform the models into observed fluxes and uncertainties in the LSST passbands (ugrizy). Although PLAsTiCC has finished, the publicly available models and simulation tools are being used within the astronomy community to further improve classification, and to study contamination in photometrically identified samples of SN Ia used to measure properties of dark energy. Our simulation framework will continue serving as a platform to improve the PLAsTiCC models, and to develop new models.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">Integral field spectroscopy (IFS) provides detailed information about galaxy kinematics at high spatial and spectral resolution, and the disentanglement of the gaseous and stellar components is a key step in the analysis of the data. We study how the use of several stellar-subtraction methods and line fitting approaches can affect the derivation of the main kinematic parameters (velocity and velocity dispersion fields) of the ionized gas component. The target of this work is the nearby galaxy NGC 2906, observed with the MUSE instrument at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). A sample of twelve spectra is selected from the inner (nucleus) and outer (spiral arms) regions, characterized by different ionization mechanisms. We compare three different methods to subtract the stellar continuum (FIT3D, STARLIGHT and pPXF), combined with one of the following stellar libraries: MILES, STELIB and GRANADA+MILES. The choice of the stellar-subtraction method is the most important ingredient affecting the derivation of the gas kinematics, followed by the choice of the stellar library and by the line-fitting approach. In our data, typical uncertainties in the observed wavelength and width of the Hα and [NII] lines are of the order of ⟨δλ⟩rms ∼0.1 Å and ⟨δσ⟩rms ∼0.2 Å (i.e., ∼5 and 10 km s−1 , respectively). The results obtained from the [NII] line seem to be slightly more robust, as it is less affected by stellar absorption than Hα. All methods considered yield statistically consistent measurements once a mean systemic contribution ∆λ = ∆σ = 0.2 ∆MUSE is added in quadrature to the line-fitting errors, where ∆MUSE =1.1Å ∼50 km s−1, which denotes the instrumental resolution of the MUSE spectra. Although the subtraction of the stellar continuum is critical in order to recover line fluxes, any method (including none) can be used to measure the gas kinematics, as long as an additional component, ∆λ = ∆σ = 0.2 ∆MUSE, is added to the error budget.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">The Photometric LSST Astronomical Time Series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC) is an open data challenge to classify simulated astronomical time-series data in preparation for observations from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which will achieve first light in 2019 and commence its 10-year main survey in 2022. LSST will revolutionize our understanding of the changing sky, discovering and measuring millions of time-varying objects. In this challenge, we pose the question: how well can we classify objects in the sky that vary in brightness from simulated LSST time-series data, with all its challenges of non-representativity? In this note we explain the need for a data challenge to help classify such astronomical sources and describe the PLAsTiCC data set and Kaggle data challenge, noting that while the references are provided for context, they are not needed to participate in the challenge.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">Massive stars are the main objects that illuminate H II regions and they evolve quickly to end their lives in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Thus it is important to investigate the association between CCSNe and H II regions. In this paper, we present emission line diagnostics of the stellar populations around nearby CCSNe, that include their host H II regions, from the PMAS/PPAK Integral-field Supernova hosts COmpilation (PISCO). We then use BPASS stellar population models to determine the age, metallicity and gas parameters for H II regions associated with CCSNe, contrasting models that consider either single star evolution alone or incorporate interacting binaries. We find binary-star models, that allow for ionizing photon loss, provide a more realistic fit to the observed CCSN hosts with metallicities that are closer to those derived from the oxygen abundance in O3N2. We also find that type II and type Ibc SNe arise from progenitor stars of similar age, mostly from 7 to 45 Myr, which corresponds to stars with masses &lt; 20 solar mass . However these two types SNe have little preference in their host environment metallicity measured by oxygen abundance or in progenitor initial mass. We note however that at lower metallicities supernovae are more likely to be of type II.<br></p>

                        A trace of past merger and active nucleus activity is found in the lensing galaxy, while the background lensed galaxy is found to be star-forming. Modeling the lensing potential with a singular isothermal ellipsoid, we find an Einstein radius of 1"45+-0"04, which corresponds to 1.9 kpc at the redshift of the lens and it is much smaller than its effective radius (Reff ~ 9"). Comparing the Einstein mass and the STARLIGHT stellar mass within the same aperture yields a dark matter fraction of 18+-8 % within the Einstein radius. The advent of large surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will discover a number of strong-lensed systems, and here we demonstrate how wide-field integral field spectroscopy offers an excellent approach to study them and to precisely model lensing effects.</p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">We present photometry, spectroscopy, and host-galaxy integral-field spectroscopy of the Type II supernova (SN II) 2016esw in CGCG 229-009 from the first day after the explosion up to 120 d. Its light-curve shape is similar to that of a typical SN II; however, SN 2016esw is near the high-luminosity end of the SN II distribution, with a peak of MmaxV=−18.36 mag. The V-band light curve exhibits a long recombination phase for a SN II (similar to the long-lived plateau of SN 2004et). Considering the well-known relation between the luminosity and the plateau decline rate, SN 2016esw should have a V-band slope of ∼2.10 mag (100 d)−1; however, SN 2016esw has a substantially flatter plateau with a slope of 1.01 ± 0.26 mag (100 d)−1, perhaps indicating that interacting Type II supernovae are not useful for cosmology. At 19.5 d post-explosion, the spectrum presents a boxy H α emission line with flat absorption profiles, suggesting interaction between the ejecta and circumstellar matter. Finally, based on the spectral properties, SN 2016esw shows similarities with the luminous and interacting SN 2007pk at early epochs, particularly in terms of observable line features and their evolution.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">
                        The maximum luminosity of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) depends on the oxygen abundance of the regions of the host galaxies, where they explode. This metallicity dependence reduces the dispersion in the Hubble diagram (HD) when included with the traditional two-parameter calibration of SN Ia light-curve parameters and absolute magnitude. In this work, we use empirical calibrations to carefully estimate the oxygen abundance of galaxies hosting SNe Ia from the SDSS-II/SN (Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II Supernova) survey at intermediate redshift by measuring their emission-line intensities. We also derive electronic temperature with the direct method for a small fraction of objects for consistency. We find a trend of decreasing oxygen abundance with increasing redshift for the most massive galaxies. Moreover, we study the dependence of the HD residuals (HR) with galaxy oxygen abundance obtaining a correlation in line with those found in other works. In particular, the HR versus oxygen abundance shows a slope of −0.186 ±  0.123 mag dex−1 (1.52σ) in good agreement with theoretical expectations. This implies smaller distance modulii after corrections for SNe Ia in metal-rich galaxies. Based on our previous results on local SNe Ia, we propose this dependence to be due to the lower luminosity of the SNe Ia produced in more metal-rich environments.</p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">We present the PMAS/PPak Integral-field Supernova hosts COmpilation (PISCO) which comprises integral field spectroscopy (IFS) of 232 supernova (SN) host galaxies, that hosted 272 SNe, observed over several semesters with the 3.5m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory (CAHA). PISCO is the largest collection of SN host galaxies observed with wide-field IFS, totaling 466,347 individual spectra covering a typical spatial resolution of $\sim$380 pc. While focused studies regarding specific SN Ia-related topics will be published elsewhere, this paper aims to present the properties of the SN environments with stellar population (SP) synthesis and the gas-phase interstellar medium, providing additional results separating stripped-envelope SNe into their subtypes. With 11,270 {\sc Hii} regions detected in all galaxies, we present for the first time an {\sc Hii} region statistical analysis, that puts {\sc Hii} regions that have hosted SNe in context with all other star forming clumps within their galaxies. SNe Ic are associated to more metal-rich, higher EW(H$\alpha$) and higher star formation rate (SFR) environments within their host galaxies than the mean of all HII regions detected within each host, on contrary SNe IIb occur at the most different environments compared to other core-collapse SNe types. We find two clear components of young and old SP at SNe IIn locations. We find that SNe II fast-decliners (IIL) tend to explode at locations where $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ is more intense. Finally, we outline how a future dedicated IFS survey of galaxies in parallel to an untargeted SN search would overcome the biases in current environmental studies.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">
                        We present observations of DES16C2nm, the first spectroscopically confirmed hydrogen-free superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) at redshift z~2. DES16C2nm was discovered by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Supernova Program, with follow-up photometric data from the Hubble Space Telescope, Gemini, and the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope supplementing the DES data. Spectroscopic observations confirm DES16C2nm to be at z=1.998, and spectroscopically similar to Gaia16apd (a SLSN-I at z=0.102), with a peak absolute magnitude of U=-22.26±0.06. The high redshift of DES16C2nm provides a unique opportunity to study the ultraviolet (UV) properties of SLSNe-I. Combining DES16C2nm with ten similar events from the literature, we show that there exists a homogeneous class of SLSNe-I in the UV (~2500A), with peak luminosities in the (rest-frame) U band, and increasing absorption to shorter wavelengths. There is no evidence that the mean photometric and spectroscopic properties of SLSNe-I differ between low (z&lt;1) and high redshift (z&gt;1), but there is clear evidence of diversity in the spectrum at &lt;2000A, possibly caused by the variations in temperature between events. No significant correlations are observed between spectral line velocities and photometric luminosity. Using these data, we estimate that SLSNe-I can be discovered to z=3.8 by DES. While SLSNe-I are typically identified from their blue observed colors at low redshift (z&lt;1), we highlight that at z&gt;2 these events appear optically red, peaking in the observer-frame z-band. Such characteristics are critical to identify these objects with future facilities such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, Euclid, and the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope, which should detect such SLSNe-I to z=3.5, 3.7, and 6.6, respectively.</p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">Although Type Ia supernova cosmology has now reached a mature state, it is important to develop as many independent methods as possible to understand the true nature of dark energy. Recent studies have shown that Type II supernovae (SNe II) offer such a path and could be used as alternative distance indicators. However, the majority of these studies were unable to extend the Hubble diagram above redshift z = 0.3 because of observational limitations. Here, we show that we are now ready to move beyond low redshifts and attempt high-redshift (z ≳ 0.3) SN II cosmology as a result of new-generation deep surveys such as the Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam survey. Applying the ‘standard candle method’ to SN 2016jhj (z = 0.3398 ± 0.0002; discovered by HSC) together with a low-redshift sample, we are able to construct the highest-redshift SN II Hubble diagram to date with an observed dispersion of 0.27 mag (i.e. 12–13 per cent in distance). This work demonstrates the bright future of SN II cosmology in the coming era of large, wide-field surveys like that of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">CO observations allow estimations of the gas content of molecular clouds, which trace the reservoir of cold gas fuelling star formation, as well as to determine extinction via H2 column density. Here, we studied millimetric and optical properties at 26 supernovae (SNe) locations of different types in a sample of 23 nearby galaxies by combining molecular 12C 16O (J=1-&gt;0) resolved maps from the EDGE survey and optical Integral Field Spectroscopy from the CALIFA survey. We found an even clearer separation between type II and type Ibc SNe in terms of molecular gas than what we found in the optical using H$\alpha$ emission as a proxy for current SF rate, which reinforces the fact that SNe Ibc are more associated with SF-environments. While Av at SN locations is similar for SNe II and SNe Ibc, and higher compared to SNe Ia, NH is significantly higher for SNe Ibc than for SNe II and SNe Ia. When compared to alternative extinction estimations directly from SN photometry and spectroscopy, we find that our SNe Ibc have also redder color excess but showed standard Na I D absorption pseudo-equivalent widths (~1 A). In some cases we find no extinction when estimated from the environment, but high amounts of extinction when measured from SN observations, which suggests that circumstellar material or dust sublimation may be playing a role. This work serves as a benchmark for future studies combining last generation millimeter and optical IFS instruments to reveal the local environmental properties of extragalactic SNe.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">Stellar populations are the building blocks of galaxies including the Milky Way. The majority, if not all extragalactic studies are entangled with the use of stellar population models given the unresolved nature of their observation. Extragalactic systems contain multiple stellar populations with complex star formation histories. However, their study is mainly based upon the principles of simple stellar populations (SSP). Hence, it is critical to examine the validity of SSP models. This work aims to empirically test the validity of SSP models. This is done by comparing SSP models against observations of spatially resolved young stellar population in the determination of its physical properties, i.e. age and metallicity. Integral field spectroscopy of a young stellar cluster in the Milky Way, NGC 3603, is used to study the properties of the cluster both as a resolved and unresolved stellar population. The unresolved stellar population is analysed using the Hα equivalent width as an age indicator, and the ratio of strong emission lines to infer metallicity. In addition, spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using STARLIGHT, is used to infer these properties from the integrated spectrum. Independently, the resolved stellar population is analysed using the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) for age and metallicity determination. As the SSP model represents the unresolved stellar population, the derived age and metallicity are put to test whether they agree with those derived from resolved stars. The age and metallicity estimate of NGC 3603 derived from integrated spectroscopy are confirmed to be within the range of those derived from the CMD of the resolved stellar population, including other estimates found in the literature. The result from this pilot study supports the reliability of SSP models for studying unresolved young stellar populations.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">The metallicity of a supernova progenitor, together with its mass, is one of the main parameters that can rule the progenitor's fate. We present the second study of nearby supernova (SN) host galaxies (0.00510$ dex) by targeted searches. We neither found evidence that the metallicity at the SN location differs from the average metallicity at the galactocentric distance of the SNe. By extending our SN sample with published metallicities at the SN location, we are able to study the metallicity distributions for all SN subtypes split into SN discovered in targeted and untargeted searches. We confirm a bias toward higher host masses and metallicities in the targeted searches. By combining data from targeted and untargeted searches, we found a sequence from higher to lower local metallicity: SN Ia, Ic, and II show the highest metallicity, which is significantly higher than those of SN Ib, IIb, and Ic-BL. Our results support the scenario according to which SN~Ib result from binary progenitors. Additionally, at least part of the SN Ic are the result of single massive stars that were stripped of their outer layers by metallicity-driven winds. We studied several proxies of the local metallicity that are frequently used in the literature and found that the total host metallicity allows estimating the metallicity at the SN location with an accuracy better than 0.08 dex and very small bias. In addition, weak AGNs that cannot be seen in the total spectrum may weakly bias (by 0.04~dex) the metallicity estimate that is derived from the galaxy-integrated spectrum.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">We present the intensive spectroscopic follow up of the type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2014J in the starburst galaxy M82. Twenty-seven optical spectra have been acquired from January 22nd to September 1st 2014 with the Isaac Newton (INT) and William Herschel (WHT) Telescopes. After correcting the observations for the recession velocity of M82 and for Milky Way and host galaxy extinction, we measured expansion velocities from spectral line blueshifts and pseudo-equivalent width of the strongest features in the spectra, which gives an idea on how elements are distributed within the ejecta. We position SN 2014J in the Benetti (2005), Branch et al. (2006) and Wang et al. (2009) diagrams. These diagrams are based on properties of the Si II features and provide dynamical and chemical information about the SN ejecta. The nearby SN 2011fe, which showed little evidence for reddening in its host galaxy, is shown as a reference for comparisons. SN 2014J is a border-line object between the Core-normal (CN) and Broad-line (BL) groups, which corresponds to an intermediate position between Low Velocity Gradient (LVG) and High Velocity Gradient (HVG) objects. SN 2014J follows the R(Si II)-\Delta m15 correlation, which confirms its classification as a relatively normal SN Ia. Our description of the SN Ia in terms of the evolution of the pseudo-equivalent width of various ions as well as the position in the various diagrams put this specific SN Ia into the overall sample of SN Ia.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">We present a statistical analysis of the environments of 11 supernovae (SNe) which occurred in 6 nearby galaxies (z ≲ 0.016). All galaxies were observed with MUSE, the high spatial resolution integral field spectrograph mounted to the 8m VLT UT4. These data enable us to map the full spatial extent of host galaxies up to ∼3 effective radii. In this way, not only can one characterise the specific host environment of each SN, one can compare their properties with stellar populations within the full range of other environments within the host. We present a method that consists of selecting all HII regions found within host galaxies from 2D extinction-corrected Hα emission maps. These regions are then characterised in terms of their Hα equivalent widths, star formation rates, and oxygen abundances. Identifying HII regions spatially coincident with SN explosion sites, we are thus able to determine where within the distributions of host galaxy e.g. metallicities and ages each SN is found, thus providing new constraints on SN progenitor properties. This initial pilot study using MUSE opens the way for a revolution in SN environment studies where we are now able to study multiple environment SN progenitor dependencies using a single instrument and single pointing.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">We present a compilation of UBV RIz light curves of 51 type II supernovae discovered during the course of four different surveys during 1986 to 2003: the Cerro Tololo Supernova Survey, the Calan/Tololo Supernova Program (C&amp;T), the Supernova Optical and Infrared Survey (SOIRS), and the Carnegie Type II Supernova Survey (CATS). The photometry is based on template-subtracted images to eliminate any potential host galaxy light contamination, and calibrated from foreground stars. This work presents these photometric data, studies the color evolution using different bands, and explores the relation between the magnitude at maximum brightness and the brightness decline parameter (s) from maximum light through the end of the recombination phase. This parameter is found to be shallower for redder bands and appears to have the best correlation in the B band. In addition, it also correlates with the plateau duration, being thus shorter (longer) for larger (smaller) s values.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">We investigate the early-time light-curves of a large sample of 223 type II supernovae (SNe) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Supernova Legacy Survey. Having a cadence of a few days and sufficient non-detections prior to explosion, we constrain rise-times, i.e. the durations from estimated first to maximum light, as a function of effective wavelength. At restframe g-band (4722A), we find a distribution of fast rise-times with median of (7.5+/-0.3) days. Comparing these durations with analytical shock models of Rabinak and Waxman (2013); Nakar and Sari (2010) and hydrodynamical models of Tominaga et al. (2009), which are mostly sensitive to progenitor radius at these epochs, we find a median characteristic radius of less than 400 solar radii. The inferred radii are on average much smaller than the radii obtained for observed red supergiants (RSG). Investigating the post-maximum slopes as a function of effective wavelength in the light of theoretical models, we find that massive hydrogen envelopes are still needed to explain the plateaus of SNe II. We therefore argue that the SN II rise-times we observe are either a) the shock cooling resulting from the core collapse of RSG with small and dense envelopes, or b) the delayed and prolonged shock breakout of the collapse of a RSG with an extended atmosphere or embedded within pre-SN circumstellar material.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">Investigations of the environments of SNe allow statistical constraints to be made on progenitor properties. We review progress that has been made in this field. Pixel statistics using tracers of e.g. star formation within galaxies show differences in the explosion sites of, in particular SNe types II and Ibc (SNe II and SNe Ibc), suggesting differences in population ages. Of particular interest is that SNe Ic are significantly more associated with H-alpha emission than SNe Ib, implying shorter lifetimes for the former. In addition, such studies have shown that the interacting SNe IIn do not explode in regions containing the most massive stars, which suggests that at least a significant fraction of their progenitors arise from the lower end of the core-collapse SN mass range. Host HII region spectroscopy has been obtained for a significant number of core-collapse events, however definitive conclusions have to-date been elusive. Single stellar evolution models predict that the fraction of SNe Ibc to SNe II should increase with increasing metallicity, due to the dependence of mass-loss rates on progenitor metallicity. We present a meta-analysis of host HII region oxygen abundances for CC SNe. It is concluded that the SN II to SN Ibc ratio shows little variation with oxygen abundance, with only a suggestion that the ratio increases in the lowest bin. Radial distributions of different SNe are discussed, where a central excess of SNe Ibc has been observed within disturbed galaxy systems, which is difficult to ascribe to metallicity or selection effects. Environment studies are evolving to enable studies at higher spatial resolutions than previously possible, while in addition the advent of wide-field integral field unit instruments allows galaxy-wide spectral analyses which will provide fruitful results to this field. Some example contemporary results are shown in that direction.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">We present a study of the HII regions in the galaxy NGC 6754 from a two pointing mosaic comprising 197,637 individual spectra, using Integral Field Spectrocopy (IFS) recently acquired with the MUSE instrument during its Science Verification program. The data cover the entire galaxy out to ~2 effective radii (re ), sampling its morphological structures with unprecedented spatial resolution for a wide-field IFU. A complete census of the H ii regions limited by the atmospheric seeing conditions was derived, comprising 396 individual ionized sources. This is one of the largest and most complete catalogue of H ii regions with spectroscopic information in a single galaxy. We use this catalogue to derive the radial abundance gradient in this SBb galaxy, finding a negative gradient with a slope consistent with the characteristic value for disk galaxies recently reported. The large number of H ii regions allow us to estimate the typical mixing scale-length (rmix ~0.4 re ), which sets strong constraints on the proposed mechanisms for metal mixing in disk galaxies, like radial movements associated with bars and spiral arms, when comparing with simulations. We found evidence for an azimuthal variation of the oxygen abundance, that may be related with the radial migration. These results illustrate the unique capabilities of MUSE for the study of the enrichment mechanisms in Local Universe galaxies.<br></p>

We also used these similarities to create SNe II light-curve templates that will be used in the future for standardize these objects and determine cosmological distances.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">We use optical IFS of nearby SN host galaxies provided by the CALIFA Survey with the goal of finding correlations in the environmental parameters at the location of different SN types. We recover the sequence in association of different SN types to the star-forming regions by using several indicators of the ongoing and recent SF related to both the ionized gas and the stellar populations. While the total ongoing SF is on average the same for the three SN types, SNe Ibc/IIb tend to happen closer to star-forming regions and occur in higher SF density locations compared to SNe II and SNe~Ia, the latter showing the weakest correlation. SNe~Ia host galaxies have on average masses that are ∼0.3-0.8~dex higher than CC SNe hosts due to a larger fraction of old stellar populations in the SNe~Ia hosts. Using the recent SN~Ia delay-time distribution and the SFHs of the galaxies, we show that the SN~Ia hosts in our sample should presently produce a factor 2 more SNe~Ia than the CC~SN hosts. Since both types are in hosts with similar SF rate and hence similar CC~SN rate, this can explain the mass difference between the SN~Ia and CC~SN hosts, and reinforce the finding that at least part of SNe~Ia should originate from very old progenitors. Comparing the mean SFH of the eight least massive galaxies to that of the massive SF SN~Ia hosts we find that the low-mass galaxies formed their stars over more extended time than the massive SN~Ia hosts. We estimate that the low-mass galaxies should produce by a factor of 10 less SNe~Ia, and a factor of 3 less CC~SNe than the high-mass group. Therefore the ratio between the number of CC~SNe and SNe~Ia is expected to increase with decreasing the galaxy mass. CC~SNe tend to explode at positions with younger stellar populations than the galaxy average, but the galaxy properties at SNe~Ia locations are one average the same as the global ones.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">This work investigates the effect of the aperture size on derived galaxy properties for which we have spatially-resolved optical spectra. We focus on some indicators of star formation activity and dust attenuation for spiral galaxies that have been widely used in previous work on galaxy evolution. We have used 104 spiral galaxies from the CALIFA survey for which 2D spectroscopy with complete spatial coverage is available. From the 3D cubes we have derived growth curves of the most conspicuous Balmer emission lines (Halpha, Hbeta) for circular apertures of different radii centered at the galaxy's nucleus after removing the underlying stellar continuum. We find that the Halpha flux (f(Halpha)) growth curve follows a well defined sequence with aperture radius showing low dispersion around the median value. From this analysis, we derive aperture corrections for galaxies in different magnitude and redshift intervals. Once stellar absorption is properly accounted for, the f(Halpha)/f(Hbeta) ratio growth curve shows a smooth decline, pointing towards the absence of differential dust attenuation as a function of radius. Aperture corrections as a function of the radius are provided in the interval [0.3,2.5]R_50. Finally, the Halpha equivalent width (EW(Halpha)) growth curve increases with the size of the aperture and shows a very large dispersion for small apertures. This large dispersion prevents the use of reliable aperture corrections for this quantity. In addition, this result suggests that separating star-forming and quiescent galaxies based on observed EW(Halpha) through small apertures is likely to result in low EW(Halpha) star-forming galaxies begin classified as quiescent.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">We use type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered by the SDSS-II SN Survey to search for dependencies between SN Ia properties and the projected distance to the host galaxy center, using the distance as a proxy for local galaxy properties (local star-formation rate, local metallicity, etc.). The sample consists of almost 200 spectroscopically or photometrically confirmed SNe Ia at redshifts below 0.25. The sample is split into two groups depending on the morphology of the host galaxy. We fit light-curves using both MLCS2k2 and SALT2, and determine color (AV, c) and light-curve shape (delta, x1) parameters for each SN Ia, as well as its residual in the Hubble diagram. We then correlate these parameters with both the physical and the normalized distances to the center of the host galaxy and look for trends in the mean values and scatters of these parameters with increasing distance. The most significant (at the 4-sigma level) finding is that the average fitted AV from MLCS2k2 and c from SALT2 decrease with the projected distance for SNe Ia in spiral galaxies. We also find indications that SNe in elliptical galaxies tend to have narrower light-curves if they explode at larger distances, although this may be due to selection effects in our sample. We do not find strong correlations between the residuals of the distance moduli with respect to the Hubble flow and the galactocentric distances, which indicates a limited correlation between SN magnitudes after standardization and local host metallicity.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">We present multi-band photometry and multi-epoch spectroscopy of the peculiar Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2007qd, discovered by the SDSS-II Supernova Survey. It possesses physical properties intermediate to those of the peculiar SN 2002cx and the extremely low-luminosity SN 2008ha. Optical photometry indicates that it had an extraordinarily fast rise time of &lt;= 10 days and a peak absolute B magnitude of -15.4 +/- 0.2 at most, making it one of the most subluminous SN Ia ever observed. Follow-up spectroscopy of SN 2007qd near maximum brightness unambiguously shows the presence of intermediate-mass elements which are likely caused by carbon/oxygen nuclear burning. Near maximum brightness, SN 2007qd had a photospheric velocity of only 2800 km/s, similar to that of SN 2008ha but about 4000 and 7000 km/s less than that of SN 2002cx and normal SN Ia, respectively. We show that the peak luminosities of SN 2002cx-like objects are highly correlated with both their light-curve stretch and photospheric velocities. Its strong apparent connection to other SN 2002cx-like events suggests that SN 2007qd is also a pure deflagration of a white dwarf, although other mechanisms cannot be ruled out. It may be a critical link between SN 2008ha and the other members of the SN 2002cx-like class of objects.<br></p>
